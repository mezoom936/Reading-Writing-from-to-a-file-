/**
 * This class is to design how the data is being processed in the csv file
 * This class has eight data fields.
 * 1. name as a string (name of the facility)
 * 2. address as a string(address of the facility)
 * 3. zipcode as an integer(zipcocde of the facility address)
 * 4. year as an integer(year to store the date year of the facility built)
 * 5. month as an integer(month to store the date year of the facility built)
 * 6. day as an integer(day to store the date year of the facility built)
 * 7. score as an integer(score that the facility has)
 * 8. grade as a character(grade that the facility has)
 * This class has a constructor with parameters, and this constructor has a try catch blocks
 * which will invoke a splitDate method to split the string date into three parts 
 * year, month, and day. And the constructor will have all the other data fields. 
 * This class also has setters and getters for the data fields and a toString method to 
 * display a representation of every facility in the csv file.
